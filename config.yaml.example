# Awakener - Configuration File
# =============================================================================
# This file contains all non-sensitive configuration for the Awakener platform.
# API keys and secrets should be placed in the .env file (never commit .env).
#
# After modifying this file, changes will take effect:
#   - Web server settings: requires restart
#   - Agent settings: applied on next activation round
# =============================================================================

# -- Web Server ---------------------------------------------------------------
# The management console web server configuration.
web:
  # Port number for the web console (default: 8080)
  port: 8080

  # Host binding address
  # Use "0.0.0.0" to allow external access, "127.0.0.1" for local only
  host: "0.0.0.0"

# -- Agent Settings -----------------------------------------------------------
# Configuration for the autonomous agent activator.
agent:

  # Working directory on the server where the agent stores its files
  # (memory, logs, notebooks, etc.)
  home: "/home/agent"

  # LLM model identifier in LiteLLM format: "provider/model-name"
  # Examples:
  #   - "deepseek/deepseek-chat"       (DeepSeek Chat, cost-effective)
  #   - "deepseek/deepseek-reasoner"   (DeepSeek Reasoner, with thinking)
  #   - "openai/gpt-4o"               (OpenAI GPT-4o)
  #   - "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-20250514"   (Anthropic Claude Sonnet)
  model: "deepseek/deepseek-chat"

  # LLM model for the system snapshot auditor.
  # The snapshot auditor updates the agent's asset inventory after each round.
  # Leave empty to use the same model as the agent.
  # Recommended: use a fast, cheap model (e.g. "deepseek/deepseek-chat").
  snapshot_model: ""

  # Time in seconds between activation rounds.
  # Set to 0 for continuous operation (no delay between rounds).
  # Recommended: 60 for normal use, 0 for fast testing.
  interval: 60

  # Maximum number of tool calls allowed per activation round.
  # Higher values let the agent do more per round but cost more tokens.
  max_tool_calls: 20

  # Timeout in seconds for shell command execution.
  # Commands running longer than this will be killed.
  shell_timeout: 30

  # Maximum characters returned from tool output (read_file, shell_execute).
  # Prevents context window overflow from large outputs.
  max_output_chars: 4000

  # Maximum characters injected from the knowledge base index (knowledge/index.md).
  # The agent's index.md is read and injected into the prompt each round.
  # If the file exceeds this limit, it is truncated with a warning.
  # Lower values save tokens; higher values give the agent more room.
  max_index_chars: 2000
