Split notebook/timeline into daily files and preserve full summaries

Storage:
- Notebook and timeline now write to per-day files under
  data/notebook/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl and data/timeline/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl.
- Reading scans all daily files (sorted by date) for full history.
- Backward compatible: legacy single-file notebook.jsonl and
  timeline.jsonl are still read if present.

Timeline content:
- Summary no longer truncated — full reasoning and output preserved.
- Each assistant turn now includes a timestamp (HH:MM:SS) in the
  summary, e.g. "[15:04:18] [Thinking] ..."

Timeline UI:
- Summary displayed as preformatted text with time prefixes.
- Long summaries show first 3 lines with a "Show more" toggle
  that expands to reveal the full content.
- Added i18n keys for show/collapse labels (EN + ZH).
