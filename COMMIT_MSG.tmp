Redesign dashboard: fullscreen log layout with reliable status updates

- Fix unreliable status display: broadcast "running" status in
  round_start() so the frontend updates when transitioning from
  "waiting" to "running"; also update status from round events as
  belt-and-suspenders; fetch status on every WebSocket reconnect.
- Add .agent-status.waiting CSS class (was missing, caused unstyled badge).
- Redesign dashboard to a single fullscreen log card:
  - One-line toolbar: status badge + stats (left), control buttons (right)
  - Log body fills remaining viewport height (no browser scrollbar)
  - Dark footer: auto-scroll toggle + inspiration input
- Remove stats-grid cards, controls card, and clear button.
- Add toolbar status badge with synchronized color and pulse animation.
- Add i18n keys for compact toolbar labels (round, tools).
